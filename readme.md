* Empirical Distribution of Glottal Edges (EDGE) is a statistical method for assessing vocal fold
kinematics using High-Speed Videoendoscopy (HSV). This method includes HSV preprocessing
and glottal edge detection to estimate global EDGE, conditional EDGE, and left/right EDGE. From
these latter two representations, the phase asymmetry (PA) and amplitude asymmetry (AA)
between the left and right vocal folds along the anterior-posterior glottal axis are calculated,
respectively.*
